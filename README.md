# Module_12

## Background 

Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. The reason is that healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, this repository will be using various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. Then using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company, a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers will be built.

## What is created?
Using the knowledge learnt from imbalanced-learn library and the logistic regression model, comparison of two dataset versions will be done. First, the original dataset. Second, resampling the data by using the RandomOverSampler module from the imbalanced-learn library. In doing so this will help find the target classes, training a logistic regression classifier, the calculation of the balanced accuracy score, a generation of a confusion matrix, and a classification report.
